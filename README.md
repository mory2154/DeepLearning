# DeepLearning
My Repository for Deep Learning Projects
# Project 1: Image classifier Project
In this project, we built a Python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, then predict new images using the trained model.

# Project 2: Machine Translation Project
In this project, we translate english sentences into their corresponding french sentences with mbedding, encoder-decoder, and bidirectional RNN.
